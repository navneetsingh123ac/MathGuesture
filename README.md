MathGesture 🎯✋📐
A gesture-based math-solving system that allows students to solve mathematical expressions using hand gestures instead of a keyboard or stylus. Powered by OpenCV, Google Gemini API, and Python, this project enables real-time gesture recognition and AI-driven equation solving.

🚀 Features
🖐 Hand Gesture Recognition – Uses OpenCV to track hand movements.

✍ Air Writing Support – Recognizes mathematical expressions drawn in the air.

🤖 AI-Powered Equation Solving – Leverages Google Gemini API for accurate results.

⚡ Real-Time Processing – Provides instant feedback and solutions.

🛠 Tech Stack
Python

OpenCV (for gesture detection)

Mediapipe (for hand tracking)

Google Gemini API (for AI-based math solving)
